                        <p>I'm a Full Stack developer currently living in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. I have a background in Mechanical Engineering and as a side-project I'm studying Master in Economics and Business Administration. The thrill at being able to bring my imagination to life has taken me on a journey from being a mechanical design engineer and finally brought me to web development.

                        Through my experiences working in an international automotive company, I had the opportunity to work in different countries in a multi-cultural teams. The combination of creative problem-solving and analytical skills that I gained in this field has prepared me to become a better developer.
